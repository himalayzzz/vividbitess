## **Problem Statement üö®:**

Millions of people worldwide experience color blindness, making it difficult for them to distinguish certain colors and access visual information accurately. Most recipe websites rely heavily on color-coded indicators, making it challenging for color-blind users to navigate recipes, ingredient lists, and buttons effectively. Additionally, visually impaired users often struggle with accessing step-by-step cooking instructions.
