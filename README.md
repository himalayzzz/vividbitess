## **Problem Statement üö®:**

Millions of people worldwide experience color blindness, making it difficult for them to distinguish certain colors and access visual information accurately.

Additionally, visually impaired users often struggle with accessing step-by-step cooking instructions.

Which is then followed by detailed instruction, a youtube video curated especially to make the process fun and detailed and topped off with a "text-to-speech" feature which allows the user to listen to the instructions given above. It also includes features to "pause/ resume" in case you require some quiet thinking time to figure out the recipe!!!!
